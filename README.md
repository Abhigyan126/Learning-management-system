# Education Database Management System

This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing an educational database using Python and MySQL. It provides functionalities to insert, delete, view, and manage records of instructors, courses, students, enrollments, and assessments. The GUI is built using Tkinter, and database operations are handled using MySQL Connector/Python.

## Features

- **Insert Operations:** Allows inserting new instructors, courses, students, enrollments, and assessments into the database.
- **Delete Operations:** Supports soft deletion (is_deleted flag) for instructors, courses, students, and assessments.
- **View Operations:** Displays records from various tables (instructors, courses, students, enrollments, assessments), including deleted records.
- **Database Integration:** Uses MySQL database for storing and managing educational data.
- **Error Handling:** Includes error messages for database operations to ensure smooth user experience.
